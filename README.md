# [Linux] Preprocessing metagenomic datasets.
Step 1. Trimgalore
Step 2. Superdeduper

# [Python] Downstream analyses (Alpha and Beta diversity analyses)
Step 3. Relative abundance bar plots
Step 4. Alpha diversity plots (Shannon, ...)

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Useful to yourself in the long run​
 - Include at least 2 notes to yourself about potential mistakes (that you had made during the class), that you don't want to make again.​
(2) Clearly written and easy to follow by a peer​
 - To your future self who is likely to forget what you have done.​
 - Like a "lab notebook", will be the basis for writing a "method section" in your future publications​
(3) Contain both Linux part and (R or Python) visualization ​​
(4) Not the entire pipeline​
 - One or two steps of Linux​
 - One or two figures in R/Python visualization ​
(5) Describe your output and how the visualization supports/illustrates the point (like a "result" section in a paper)
(6) Submit the link to your own GitHub repository
